BBeennggaalluurruu''ss  wwaassttee  pprroocceessssiinngg  uunniittss,on  acres of government land in kannahalli a tiny village located off the busy magadi road nice road junction is the second largest waste processing unit in bengaluru this plant built at a cost of rs  crore more than two years ago has the capacity to handle  tonnes of waste per day  for the past three weeks the processing machines have been motionless there has been no trace of trucks that bring waste workers come only to play cricket in the yard the plant is non functional  kannahalli is just a sixth of the citys waste processing problem five other waste processing plants  located at seegehalli lingadheeranahalli subbarayanapalya doddabidirakallu and chikkanagamangala  too have come to a standstill in the past six months  these six waste processing plants were established more than two years ago as a result of a crisis village after village on the outskirts of bengaluru rose up to protest the dumping of bengalurus garbage into landfills there when there was a six month deadline to find a solution within the city chief minister siddaramaiah tasked the bbmp with finding alternatives   a case of quick fix darpan jain an ias officer who was then the special commissioner for bbmps solid waste management was given a mandate to solve the problem within six months in a rush to find locations the bbmp decided to convert its smaller landfills in six areas into waste processing plants  the government then earmarked  crore for the establishment operation and maintenance of these plants the project was to be implemented through the karnataka urban infrastructure development finance corporation of which darpan jain was the managing director says venkatesh murthy ceo om of swm plants  soon the bbmp issued contracts to three companies  ilfs morgan solid waste company holdings and upl while ilfs was given the om of three plants the other two were to handle the remaining three plants the bbmp in its contract replaced input based tipping fee with outputbased tipping fee the idea was to pay the companies based on the quantity of compost they generate this was to avoid the firms from resorting to irregularities to get the payments sarfaraz khan joint commissioner for swm says  accordingly the companies were to get around  per tonne from the agriculture department for the compost sold and an additional rs  per tonne from the bbmp   a bad mix up but that is where the issue started right from the beginning the waste processing units which were supposed to receive only wet waste received huge quantities of mixed waste it led to the piling up of refuse derived fuel rdf and the compost remained unsold due its poor quality the companies failed to get any returns observes sandhya narayan from solid waste management round table  it was only a year after these units were set up that the bbmp made it mandatory for all of these plants to accept only the wet waste and that led to a decrease in the quantity of incoming waste  a person who has watched the developments closely points at three factors which resulted in the collapse of the system first the contract terms were not in favour of the companies because the payment quoted was really low second the bbmp was not paying the companies on time for the compost sold third the quality of compost produced was bad and it was not finding a market  of the three companies which were part of the system only ilfs stayed on c basavaiah consultant to ilfs and a member of bbmps expert committee on solid waste management sees it as a chain reaction unable to sell the compost the companies were finding it difficult to get returns for their expenditure on om it is only in the recent past that ilfs has managed to sell the compost he says this is said to be because of the agriculture departments intervention    blame it on villagers for every tonne of compost sold to raitha samparka kendras the company gets  from the agriculture department  from the bbmp and additional  as market development assistance under the swachh bharat mission basavaiah claims that the company has sold  tonne of compost since october and the company has a stock of  tonne waiting to be sold  apart from compost the rdf generated in plants are given to cement manufacturing factories for free it is mandatory for cement companies to use  of solid waste in their manufacturing process  ideally these processing plants should accept only the wet waste while the compost is sold to farmers the minimum rdf generated is to be given to cement factories but mixed waste as input has damaged the entire process says shekar prabhakar cofounder and managing director of hasiru dala  bbmps sarfaraz khan blames villagers for the non functioning of the plants there has been a protest every time the intake and processing of waste was huge this has prevented us from accepting waste in a large quantity the plants will resume functioning after elections it is definitely not a death of the project he says  till then bengalurus waste  wet dry and mixed  approximately  tonne per day is dumped in bellahalli quarry  km from the city  but bellahalli is a time bomb waiting to explode says shekar  with the bbmp now deciding to convert the existing doddabidirakallu and chikkanagamangala waste processing units into waste to energy plants the issue is now back to square one according to sources even ilfs has expressed interest to convert its units into wte plants  the plan to accept mixed waste for wte is not the solution while the rules and court orders have made waste segregation mandatory and bengaluru making some achievement in this direction it now appears like we are moving backwards from waste segregation to mixing the waste and the bbmp is facilitating it sandhya notes   ,0.42857142857142855,0.5714285714285714,0.8233438485804416,neutral
